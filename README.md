# @cryb/eslint-config

*\- shared ESLint config for Cryb projects*

This package contains ESLint rules which are shared through Cryb components.
It includes all required dependencies by default, but has `eslint@7` and `typescript` as peer dependencies.

Rules are based of `eslint-config-standard-with-typescript` and `eslint-plugin-jsdoc`,
with Cryb's code style applied in. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/crybapp/library/blob/master/code-style/README.md).
